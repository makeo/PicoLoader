# PicoLoader
This is an ODE-based modchip for the Nintendo GameCube to boot homebrew.\
Its price and functionality are very similar to [PicoBoot](https://github.com/webhdx/PicoBoot) but it has multiple advantages.

## How does it work?
This mod works by emulating a disk drive during boot, executing a homebrew app, and afterwards re-enabling the disk drive.\
This is achieved using a flex PCB similar to FlippyDrive.
However, it is not a full optical drive emulator and only allows executing small homebrew apps (e.g. [swiss](https://github.com/emukidid/swiss-gc)) from flash just like PicoBoot.
To access files on an SD card, you need an SDGecko, SD2SP2, or similar adapter, which can be purchased separately.

## Features
- Open source
- You can keep the disk drive
- Simple to boot most homebrew apps using an [online converter](https://makeo.github.io/PicoLoader/converter/)
- No permanent modifications to the GameCube
- [3D printed plug](https://github.com/makeo/PicoLoader/raw/refs/heads/main/mount/Drive_PlugV1.1.stl) for installs without a disk drive 
- Easy to remove
- Running Pico at 200Mhz for better compatibility with clone boards

#### Soldered Variant
- Cheap and easy to get components (Raspberry Pi Pico/Pico 2 + Flex PCB + Diode)
- Readily available
- No soldering directly to the GameCube
- Easy soldering
- Alternative install options: [Panasonic Q](https://github.com/makeo/PicoLoader/wiki/4.-Advanced-Section#panasonic-q-install-option), [low-profile](https://github.com/makeo/PicoLoader/wiki/4.-Advanced-Section#low-profile-install-option)

#### Solderless Variant
- No soldering
- Easily replaceable flex PCB
- Pre-programmed with PicoLoader firmware and [Swiss](https://github.com/emukidid/swiss-gc)
> [!TIP]
> You can buy the solderless and normal variant from [store.makstech.io](https://store.makstech.io/).
